# battleboard
This is a recreation of the game BattleShip, with both a regular and blitz mode, in which a player and the computer battle it out to place, guess, and win!

This code fully compiles

The Battleboard.java class was isn't an actual class in the game, its just a snippet of code for the printing of the boards that was frequently used

Here is the break up of our work for this project:

Kai:
- Tester.java
- GuessBoard.java


Ryan: 
- created and printed all three of the boards (Battleboard.java)
- playerGuess() function in ComputerBoard.java


Daniel: 
- placeShips() for PlayerBoard.java and ComputerBoard.java (both regular and blitz modes)
- computerGuess() in ComputerBoard.java
- Game.java
- housekeeping, overall comments
