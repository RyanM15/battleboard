**OK - so what to do now?**
  Well - you should practice manipulating an array, for hours of fun.  Use ints, strings, doubles, etc.

**What about the assignment?**
  Right. You will create an 8x8 2D array that simulates a Battleship playing board and add elements to it.
  
**Don't you play with two boards?**
  Hold on... let take this in small chunks

**Right, whats a 2D array?**
  An array with two dimensions, think rows and columns.
  
**huh?**
  Think of a table in HTML - building a row of cells, then adding another row of cells, etc.  If you apply the same concept, 
  you can create the same idea with two sets of square brackets.  
  
  # int[][] numbers = new int[8][8]; 
  
  Where we have created a table with 8 rows of 8 columns.  **(Notice my description there, 8 rows OF 8 columns)**
